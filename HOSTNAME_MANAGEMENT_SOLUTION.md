# Hostname Management Solution

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Changing a client's hostname would break all existing short URLs, causing 404 errors for previously generated links.

**Root Cause**: The system builds short URLs using the client's hostname, but looks up clients by hostname during redirects. If hostname changes, the lookup fails.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Hostname Immutability ✅

**Implementation**: Added validation to prevent hostname changes after client creation.

```ruby
# In DynamicLinks::Client model
validate :hostname_immutable, on: :update

private

def hostname_immutable
  return unless hostname_changed?
  errors.add(:hostname, 'cannot be changed after creation as it would break existing short URLs')
end
```

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Prevents breaking existing short URLs
- ✅ Clear error message explains why
- ✅ Allows all other field updates
- ✅ Protects data integrity

### 2. Dynamic Host Authorization ✅

**Current System**: Already implemented and working

- Uses live database queries: `DynamicLinks::Client.exists?(hostname: [host, host_with_port])`
- **No restart required** when adding new clients
- New clients work immediately

### 3. Enhanced URL Validation ✅

**Implementation**: Hybrid static + dynamic allowlist system

```ruby
def self.allowed_host?(host)
  # Check static configuration first
  if static_allowlist_allows?(host, allowed_hosts)
    return true
  end

  # Fallback to dynamic client hostnames
  dynamic_client_host_allowed?(host)
end

def self.dynamic_client_host_allowed?(host)
  DynamicLinks::Client.exists?(hostname: normalized_host)
end
```

**Benefits**:

- ✅ **No restart required** for new clients
- ✅ Supports both static config and dynamic database lookups
- ✅ Maintains security (prevents bypass attacks)
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Graceful error handling during DB issues

## Usage Examples

### Adding New Clients (No Restart Required)

```ruby
# Create new client
client = DynamicLinks::Client.create!(
  name: 'New Client',
  api_key: 'new_api_key',
  hostname: 'new.example.com',
  scheme: 'https'
)

# Immediately works for:
# 1. Host authorization (Rails allows requests to new.example.com)
# 2. URL validation (new.example.com passes allowlist check)
# 3. Short URL generation (creates URLs with new.example.com)
# 4. Redirect functionality (finds client by hostname)
```

### Hostname Protection

```ruby
# This works (creating new client)
client = DynamicLinks::Client.create!(hostname: 'example.com', ...)

# This fails (trying to change hostname)
client.update(hostname: 'new.example.com')
# => ValidationError: "hostname cannot be changed after creation as it would break existing short URLs"

# This works (changing other fields)
client.update(name: 'New Name', scheme: 'https')
# => Success
```

### Security Configuration

```ruby
# Option 1: Static allowlist (requires restart when config changes)
DynamicLinks.configure do |config|
  config.allowed_redirect_hosts = ['trusted.com', 'safe.org']
end

# Option 2: Dynamic database checking (no restart required)
DynamicLinks.configure do |config|
  config.allowed_redirect_hosts = [] # Empty = use database
end

# Option 3: Hybrid (static + dynamic fallback)
DynamicLinks.configure do |config|
  config.allowed_redirect_hosts = ['high-priority.com']
  # Also checks database for registered client hostnames
end
```

## Testing

| **Hostname Changes**    | 💥 **Breaks all URLs**          | ✅ **Prevented with clear error** |
| **URL Validation**      | ⚠️ **Security vulnerabilities** | ✅ **Secure + Dynamic**           |
| **Host Authorization**  | ✅ Dynamic                      | ✅ **Still dynamic**              |
| **Performance**         | ✅ Good                         | ✅ **Same or better**             |
| **Security**            | ❌ **Vulnerable to bypass**     | ✅ **Secure allowlist**           |

## Key Takeaways

1. **No restart required** for adding new clients - everything is dynamic
2. **Hostname changes prevented** - protects existing URLs from breaking
3. **Enhanced security** - proper allowlist validation prevents bypass attacks
4. **Backward compatible** - existing functionality preserved
5. **Comprehensive testing** - all scenarios covered with automated tests

This solution provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly hostname management system that prevents data loss while maintaining operational flexibility.
